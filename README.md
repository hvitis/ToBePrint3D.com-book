The world of 3D printing is very big. The world of bussiness and economy is even bigger. There is very few people if any that could have extensive knowledge on all the possible subjects of 3D printing for selling.

We aim to gather knowledge from specialists and make it as thorough, wide and interdisciplinary as possible so that you - the reader - can forge your own way into the indystry without being a copycat.
